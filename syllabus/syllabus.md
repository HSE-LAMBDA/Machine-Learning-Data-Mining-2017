### Syllabus

Three parts:
- traditional learning;
- deep learning;
- 'big' learning.

### Traditional learning

Meta learning:
- No-Free-Lunch, bias-variance decomposition, regularization;
- bagging: Random Forest, Extra Trees; stacking: calibration;
- boosting: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting;
- partical session: boosting for computer vision;
- **homework**: Viola-Jones cascades.

### Traditional learning

Algorithm-invariant topics:
- optimization: gradient and gradient-free methods, global optimization;
- imbalanced datasets, reweighting, importance sampling;
- one-class and semi-supervised learning.

### Deep Learning

*I highly recommend to attend 'Deep Learning' course by Alexander Panin.
In order to avoid overlaps, this section is more-or-less complementary to that course.*

Deep Learning:
- Deep Learning and No-Free-Lunch;
- regularization, pretraining and other tricks;
- autoencoders;
- energy-based learning;
- generative models: Ristricted Boltzman Machine;
- generative models: Generative Adversarial Networks;
- **homework**: a number of exercises.

### Big Data

Big data:
- introduction to distributed computations with Spark;
- distributed Machine Learning algorithms;
- **homework**: distributed logistic regression.

### Requirements

For the first part, please, make sure you have installed:
- python 3;
- Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib;
- numpy, scipy, scikit-learn;
- (optionally) XGBoost;
